                        <p class="section-subtitle">——On the Image Beauty of the Movie "The Girl with Pearl Earrings"</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>With its flat, full-focus background, unadulterated by a hint of excess colour and prominent three-dimensional effect, 
                        Dutch master painter Johannes Vermeer has created a portrait of a young girl that stands out from the rest.
                        A more straightforward and powerful approach is adopted in both the treatment of light and shade and the relationship between light and dark, 
                        allowing the gaze of the young girl to draw you in.
                        The delicate, youthful texture of milk is punctuated by the artist's seductive, red lips, which open slightly and meet our gaze as if murmuring something.
                        This new style, full of slight exaggeration and emotional richness, makes the viewer stop and think.
                    </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Beauty is a perceptual concept of mankind, and the most universal topics are probably inseparable from beauty. Therefore, in 2003, 
                                            the British director Weber put a work adapted from a famous painting on the big screen.
                                            From a certain perspective, this romance film starring Scarlett is more like a silent oil painting intertwined with color and light.
                                            In the film, the director did not give the protagonists more lines of dialogue, but instead focused on the true nature of the characters. 
                                            The meticulous composition is matched with quiet and emotional light colors, making the facial 
                                            expressions or body movements of the characters in the close-up shot, full of the beauty of unconcealed desire.
                                            At the beginning of the film, the close-up of the female protagonist’s hand skin slides, and when the film’s climax is the portrait of the 
                                            female protagonist, the closed studio is filled with strong desires, but the composition leaves space and cool-toned corner details. 
                                            But it made the heroine's lips and looking back seem to be both seductive and sexy while retaining the innocence of a girl.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        When deciding to convey an unquenchable beauty of desire as a structural element throughout a film, what the director has to do is not only
                         tell the story and express the philosophy, 
                        but also focus on the beauty of color rendering.
                         As an important modeling element of film and television art, the director draws a unique style of color pedigree with the help of the colors of the lights, scenery, 
                         props and costumes in the play, which constitutes the connotation of the story at different stages.
                         In terms of character creation, the overall tone of the heroine, from the cold blue tone at the beginning of the story to the warm and 
                         warm orange tone when seeing the painter and painting, matched with a humble maid outfit and a white and flawless head covering.
                         All of these reveal the ups and downs of the characters' moods from the changes in their colors, from loneliness and indisputability to hidden
                          heart palpitations to uncontrollable desires, implicitly and slowly expressed by the thick and gentle overall color style.

                    <p>
                        Ridan wrote in the book "The Aesthetics of Films": "Color is like a canvas on the screen. It is not only a means of expressing 
                        images and the appearance of things, but it also plays an important role in explaining the inner appearance of the characters described. Plays an important role,
                         Color is an important means of psychological portrayal of images. "When there is nowhere to hide the hot emotions of the male and female
                          protagonists, the color of the film has changed from blue to warm red. This is the materialized form of lust and emotion biting the two people's hearts.
                         Ink and color, but implicit aesthetics, shows the inner desire of the characters to blend with each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/gallery-images/review2.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The colour tone of the film is fundamentally beautiful and depressing, encompassing the desire of two people who are in love but repressed 
                        by reality and reason, a metaphor for the European civilisation of the time, which was under the impact of commercial civilisation.
                        As painters began to curry favour with the secularisation of the merchant middle class, the form of art was forced to change course 
                        in line with the direction of demand. The painter Vermeer was suffering from mental isolation and the oppression of the present.
                        The technical mastery of painting is transposed to the curtain and turned into exquisite compositions that portray the inextricable 
                        beauty of desire between the figures through space and position, giving a sense of balance and harmony.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the film turns into a cool tone again, the moving space of the long lens and the alienation of pulling 
                        the lens all seem to declare that everything just now is just a mere splash in the journey of life. In a blink of an eye,
                         That repressed and impulsive desire returned to its original position. Only the famous painting that survived the world silently 
                         recorded the beauty of this unconcealed desire.
                    </p>
