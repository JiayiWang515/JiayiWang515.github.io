                        <p class="section-subtitle">——Analysis on the plot structure, image color, mirror movement and camera position of the movie</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The film tells the story of Manuela, after his son Esther died in an accident, in order to fulfill his son's last wish to meet his father, Laura, 
                        he traveled thousands of miles to find her husband. "All About My Mother" can be said to be Almodóvar's most successful film since filming.
                        It won the 1999 Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award, the 12th European Film Festival Best Picture, Director,
                         Actor Award, the 2000 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the 72nd Oscar Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

                                            Almodóvar once said: "It is a film that excites me very much. I think the whole film represents all of me. What I want to tell is the 
                                            inner spontaneous simplicity of women.
                                             Tell how they helped each other and this kind of mutual assistance is the only thing they have. "Like Almodovar's past works,
                                              this film still uses the female psychology as a camera, trying to express and care for it.
                                             He is good at using light and shadow to create a magnificent and mottled world. The light and shadow gently touch the inner feelings of women. 
                                             It is difficult for them to express the desire and emotion that they want to explode.

                        ————The plot structure of "All About My Mother"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The narrative structure indicates the overall structure of a film. It is the skeleton and backbone of the life of the film, and is the most important aspect 
                        of establishing the basic appearance and style characteristics of a film.
                         The film adopts a dramatic linear structure, and mostly uses causal narrative power to advance the narrative process.
                         This narrative structure is the most commonly used in Almodóvar’s works, such as "Law of Desire" and "Woman on the Edge 
                         of Collapse". They all develop normally in chronological order, following the dramatic structure pattern of beginning-development-climax-ending.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the first part, a tragedy cuts into the follow-up plot. The single mother Manuela and her son depend on each other for life, but the son is in a car accident. Because of the son's regret for the absence
                         of his father, Manuela embarks on the road to find her ex-husband.
                         In the second part, Manuela met his friend A Yue, nun Rosa, actor Hongyan, etc. while looking for her, taking 
                         care of Rosa and giving birth to her children. As part of the development of the movie, it portrays Manuela and 
                         other disadvantaged groups who are positive and strong in life. image of.
                         The third part is the climax part. Rosa gave birth but died after giving birth. Manuela met her ex-husband at the funeral. 
                         The conflict was finally reconciled and she took Rosa and her ex-husband’s child to leave.
                         In the fourth part of the ending, Manuela took the child to visit her old friend two years later. The whole film revolves around 
                         the narrative of Manuela's experience and psychological changes, adding other character lines 
                         and in-play elements to make the narrative full and touching.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Narrative in chronological order will make the story thinner, but this film does not lose its observability, because the director pays more attention to drama conflicts and character states, such as the ups and downs of Manuela’s life and emotions.
                         Almodóvar also increased the suspense and drama of the film by hiding Lola's identity. The structure of its narrative structure is ingenious and appropriate, rich in narrative layers, rhythm and artistic charm.
                         Almodóvar was influenced by Hitchcock in some films, but his use of suspense was not so intentional.
                         Hitchcock follows classical narrative rules, while Almodovar’s narrative rules are both classical 
                         and postmodern. He chose a more direct and popular narrative method.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the suspense is set, it will mobilize the nervous state of watching emotions, and will be in a tight and exhausted state in the psychological rhythm. But like Almodovar, there was suspense naturally due to the need of the plot, and it was unwittingly unwittingly.
                         This seems to be a deconstruction and subversion of the classical suspense setting. The setting of inadvertently rendering the suspense and the unraveling of the suspense make the rhythm of the film always relaxed and not too tense or slack.
                         Therefore, the suspense of Almodóvar's film is not to emphasize the rhythm, but to balance the rhythm.

                        ———— "All About My Mother" video color
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scenery and costumes of the characters in the movie "Everything About My Mother" all show a strong baroque color. There are three main colors in this movie, red, blue and black.
                         These colors set up the story line, and use the color tone to lay the mood of the characters 
                         in the story and the theme to be expressed. The three colors are very visually impactful and full of strong visual rhythm.
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/gallery-images/R14.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Red appeared first. Manuela almost always wears red clothes. Red is everywhere in this film, symbolizing life. Almodovar uses Eastman color film to produce Hitchcock-like saturation and color.
                         Red also symbolizes change, and all the characters wearing red clothes have been changed. 
                         From the first shot, it can be seen that Manuela has a connected story line with Rosa, because 
                         of the similarity in color, it even looks alike.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/gallery-images/R13.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rhythm of color is the externalization of the character's mentality and emotion. Its changes are complementary to human physical and psychological changes. At these rhythm points, the appearance of red plays a role in strengthening the rhythm. The beautiful downgrade shot here is a subjective shot of Esteban who was hit by a car.
                         In the night rain, accompanied by heart-piercing shouts, Manuela dressed in a red windbreaker ran 
                         from the right side to the left side of the camera, and rushed towards his son Esteban who fell to the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this time, if only to express her despair and grief in the dark, humid and cold night rain of early autumn, it is a general design, but Almodovar went the other way, using a fiery red windbreaker to highlight Manuela in the night rain. State of mind.
                         The color representing warmth, hope, enthusiasm and love, but at this time only to highlight the image of Manuela who was in extreme pain in the dark rainy night.
                         Red is a symbol of Manuela's broken and bleeding heart. The whole lens is wet and fuzzy, only 
                         the eye-catching red is shocking. The angle of the lens and the red windbreaker hit the drum with a strong rhythm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here, Almodovar uses blue to herald dramatic changes or death. At the beginning of the movie, 
                        Esteban, the heroine's son, is dressed in blue, the color marking his death.
                    </p>

                    <P>
                        At the beginning of this series of shots, his gentleness towards his mother was also reflected in the color of his clothes, which was red.
                         Then a saturated blue background appeared in the scene, reflected on the character's face, 
                         indicating that death was imminent, and soon, Esteban's bad news came. The importance of these two colors 
                         is highlighted in the weakened exterior wall of the theater.

                    <p>
                        In the second part, Manuela catches a glimpse of Rosa in the crowd. She is wearing blue clothes 
                        with a death mark. Even her child Esteban is in danger because of the blue lid of the baby bottle.
                         But in the end he broke the shadow curse and continued to live.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The last main color is black. It follows death and symbolizes emptiness. Just like the previous heart transplant montage, Manuela and his friends wore black. Later, Lola kissed the little Espante. His life has finally been given a new color.
                         The colors in Almodovar's films are the most impressive. When he wants color to create meaning, he will choose soft tones and dark and elegant tones.

                         With more fixed lenses, combined with warm-toned scenery, the overall picture has a very delicate aesthetics, showing a family-like characteristic.

                        The opening part of the film, the scene of the tragic ending, promotes the development of the subsequent story. This paragraph lasts for 18 minutes and includes 9 scenes. Almodóvar’s natural and beautiful mirror, he will satire and tragic scenes,
                         Films were introduced one after another. These few sets of shots brought her little happiness to an abrupt end. All the things she thought could be put down resurfaced. She had to start from the beginning and continue to live her life in a certain way.
                         This scene is particularly important. Almodovar used an anamorphic lens to shoot.
                         It was a brand new technology at that time. At this professional stage, he prefers fixed focus lens or wide-angle lens 
                         or telephoto lens, while anamorphic lens allows him to obtain a wider and open picture without distortion on the human face, 
                         and also achieve the effect of shallow depth of field.

                        This scene starts with Esteban sitting in the coffee shop opposite the theater. A huge red smoke poster decorating 
                        the outer wall of the theater can be concluded that he is comparing his mother with red smoke. Perhaps he thinks
                        they're equally beautiful.

                    Almodovar usually puts his character on both ends of the anamorphic lens. On a computer monitor or a smaller screen, our eyes can shift from one actor to another.
                    But on the big screen, you have to turn your neck down, and you need to work harder to better understand these characters.
                    When Manuela watched her son approach, the camera moved from the long shot to the close-up. The composition used 
                    the rule of thirds. He usually cut the actor's head slightly so that it was a little bit against the frame.
                    This scene is a warning to what is about to happen. The director uses a variety of methods to remind the audience, 
                    such as this scene, he foreshadows Esteban's death and Manuela's reaction, because it will happen in a few minutes.

                        Before Nina and Red Smoke appeared, the lens was always close-up. At the same time, the picture returns to the middle shot, and then may be inspired by the accident scene of John Casawaits's "Night of the Premiere", but Almodóvar is more straightforward.
                         Almodóvar initially wanted to shoot with a special effect tracking lens, but on the day of the shooting he didn't 
                         like the shooting effect so he was at the last minute. He improvised this unique shot, coupled with the protagonist'
                         s best interpretation of the character's emotions, so that the audience can be more deeply immersed in the scene.

                        In terms of camera movement, Almodovar also has two iconic methods.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One is the rapid forward pull and backward push of the lens. Its application was discovered when Esteban was hit for the first time and this montage. This forward push lens can transmit all information.
                         The functional element here is that Almodovar wants to present a close-up to the audience, but also incorporates some background 
                         elements to achieve the effect efficiently, the camera starts slowly, and then advances quickly.
                    </p>

                        Almodovar’s films are the best textbooks to tell about postmodernism. The whole chapter is a life-like performance of unfettered whimsical ideas, but the background is often like advertising pictures, chattering, and does not affect the freedom of camera language, the story It is popular and vivid. The philosophy is profound and simple. The analysis of human nature does not leave any affection, but it makes you feel humorous and kind. Almodovar was born out of a deep Spanish national cinema tradition, but after you watch his films, you always feel that there is something else.
                         Almodovar said that he has "three mentors"-Hitchcock, Billy Wilder and Bunuel. "Hitchcock makes the highly artistic image understandable to the general audience, Wilder To describe the true story of pain as a comedy,
                         Bunuel puts the illusions of fantasy and surrealism in everyday scenes." He calls them his "Trinity Art Symbols."

                        As a result, Almodovar has become one of only a few such directors in the world today. He does not conceal the shadow of Hollywood in his style, and he can completely ignore Hollywood and survive independently.
                         After Tarkovsky and Kislovsky left one after another, Almodovar has used his unique way to represent the rational light of European cinema.
